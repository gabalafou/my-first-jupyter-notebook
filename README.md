# my-first-jupyter-notebook

If you've found this repo on GitHub in your browser, then all you need to do is click on [the .ipynb file](https://github.com/gabalafou/my-first-jupyter-notebook/blob/main/linear-regression.ipynb) and GitHub will render it in your browser. 

If you want to interact with this repo on your own computer, then you need to download the repo, install JupyterLab, and then on the command line go into this repo and run the `jupyter-lab` command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabalafou/my-first-jupyter-notebook.git
cd my-first-jupyter-notebook
jupyter-lab
```

That command will open up the JupityerLab UI in your default browser, where you will be able to modify and interact with the notebook. Note that you may need to install additional libraries (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib) on your system before you can run the code in the notebook.
